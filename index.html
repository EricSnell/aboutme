      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating things that have a positive effect on people. I do a lot of music production and sound design within the electronic and hip hop styles, as well as some audio engineering. I love the creative
    process and the technology that helps it. I'm down to Earth, I love me some Netflix binging, and I'm not afraid to eat a toaster stroodle cold. </p>
      <p>It's important to me to make sure that I'm always challenging myself and learning new things, and that whatever it is I'm doing, I'm giving it my all and not holding back. This is why the bootcamp idea appealed to me so much, since you have to throw
    yourself completely into it.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in the Midwest, I hail from a city known as Akron, in the state of Ohio (that one place you've probably flown over a couple of times but never dared to visit). The city is home of <a href="http://theblackkeys.com">The Black Keys</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James">Lebron James</a>, and the greatest hamburger joint in all the realm, <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/food/index.ssf/2015/12/galley_boy_at_swensons_drive-i.html">"Swensons"</a>.</p>

      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
      <p>I'm into filmmaking, gaming, watching movies (especially the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7rg8C8w5ZY">really bad 80s horror</a> ones), learning marketing/entrepreneurial stuffs, and making sure that my work out plan always starts next week.</p>
      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
      <p>Running my own online music production business, distributing digital products and services (such as audio samples, tutorials, and website services). It's a dream I'm currently working on, but in the meantime I'd love to work for any company where I
    can develop my skills as a web developer while having a genuine interest in the company.</p>
      <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
      <p>Lately my Spotify playlist has been filled with experimental hip hop, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ScYz9sNaQk">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tennysonmusic/sets/like-what-ep">Tennyson</a>, along with the drum
    and bass tunes on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/spor">Spor</a>'s most recent album.</p>
